        Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is data format designed for small code size and small message size.
        There is a need for the ability to have the basic security services defined for this data format.
        This document specifies how to do signatures, message authentication codes and encryption using this data format.

    <section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

      <t>
        There has been an increased focus on the small, constrained devices that make up the Internet of Things (IOT). 
        One of the standards that has come of of this process is the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR). 
        CBOR extended the data model of the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) by allowing for binary data among other changes. 
        CBOR is being adopted by several of the IETF working groups dealing with the IOT world as their encoding of data structures. 
        CBOR was designed specifically to be both small in terms of messages transport and implementation size as well having a schema free decoder.
        A need exists to provide basic message security services for IOT and using CBOR as the message encoding format makes sense.
      </t>

      <t>
        The JOSE working group produced a set of documents <xref target="RFC7515"/><xref target="RFC7516"/><xref target="RFC7517"/><xref target="RFC7518"/> that defined how to perform encryption, signatures and message authentication (MAC) operations for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents and then to encode the results using the JSON format <xref target="RFC7159"/>.
        This document does the same work for use with the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <xref target="RFC7049"/> document format.
        While there is a strong attempt to keep the flavor of the original JOSE documents, two considerations are taken into account:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            CBOR has capabilities that are not present in JSON and should be used. 
            One example of this is the fact that CBOR has a method of encoding binary directly without first converting it into a base64 encoded string.
          </t>
          <t>
            The author did not always agree with some of the decisions made by the JOSE working group. 
            Many of these decisions have been re-examined, and where it seems to the author to be superior or simpler, replaced.

              Remove the flattened mode of encoding. 
              Forcing the use of an array of recipients at all times forces the message size to be two bytes larger, but one gets a corresponding decrease in the implementation size that should compensate for this.

          While we describe the CBOR structures in prose, they are agumented in the text by the use of the CBOR Data Definition Language (CDDL) <xref target="I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl"/>.
          The use of CDDL is intended to be explanitory.

        <t>
          In JSON, maps are called objects and only have one kind of map key: a string.
          In COSE, we use both strings and integers (both negative and non-negative integers) as map keys, as well as data items to identify specific choices.
          The integers (both positive and negative) are used for compactness of encoding and easy comparison.
          (Generally, in this document the value zero is going to be reserved and not used.)
          Since the work "key" is mainly used in its other meaning, as a cryptographic key, we use the term "label" for this usage of either an integer or a string to identify map keys and choice data items.

          In this document we use the following terminology:

            I have not gone through the document to determine what needs to be here yet.
            We mostly want to grab terms which are used in unusual ways or are not generally understood.

        <t>
          Key management is used as a term to describe how a key at level n is obtained from level n+1 in encrypted and MACed messages.
          The term is also used to discuss key life cycle management,  this document does not discuss key life cycle operations.

      <section title="Mandatory to Implement Algorithms">
        <t>
          One of the issues that needs to be addressed is a requirement that a standard specify a set of algorithms that are required to be implemented.
          <cref source="JLS">
            It would be possible to extend this section to talk about those decisions which an application needs to think about rather than just talking about MTI algoithms.
          </cref>
          This is done to promote interoperability as it provides a minimal set of algorithms that all devices can be sure will exist at both ends.
          However, we have elected not to specify a set of mandatory algorithms in this document.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is expected that COSE is going to be used in a wide variety of applications and on a wide variety of devices.
          Many of the constrained devices are going to be setup to used a small fixed set of algorithms, and this set of algorithms may not match those available on a device.
          We therefore have deferred to the application protocols the decision of what to specify for mandatory algorithms.
        </t>

        <t>
          Since the set of algorithms in an environment of constrained devices may depend on what the set of devices are and how long they have been in operation, we want to highlight that application protocols will need to specify some type of discovery method of algorithm capabilities.
          The discovery method may be as simple as requiring preconfiguration of the set of algorithms to providing a discovery method built into the protocol.
          S/MIME provided a number of different ways to approach the problem:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>Advertising in the message (S/MIME capabilities) <xref target="RFC5751"/>.</t>

        </t>
      </section>

    </section>
    
    <section anchor="the-cosemsg-structure" title="The COSE_MSG structure">

      <t>
        The COSE_MSG structure is a top level CBOR object that corresponds to the DataContent type in the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) <xref target="RFC5652"/>.
        This structure allows for a top level message to be sent that could be any of the different security services.
        The security service is identified within the message.
      </t>

      <t>
        The COSE_Tagged_MSG CBOR type takes the COSE_MSG and prepends a CBOR tag of TBD1 to the encoding of COSE_MSG.
        By having both a tagged and untagged version of the COSE_MSG structure, it becomes easy to either use COSE_MSG as a top level object or embedded in another object.
        The tagged version allows for a method of placing the COSE_MSG structure into a choice, using a consistent tag value to determine that this is a COSE object.
      </t>

      <t>
        The existence of the COSE_MSG and COSE_Tagged_MSG CBOR data types are not intended to prevent protocols from using the individual security primitives directly.
        Where only a single service is required, that structure can be used directly.
      </t>

      <t>
        Each of the top-level security objects use a CBOR map as the base structure.
        Items in the map at the top level are identified by a label.
        The type of the value associated with the label is determined by the definition of the label.
        
        <!-- M00TODO:
             JLS:  While I want to point to the registry at some point, I don't think this is the correct sentence and place to do it.
             Figure out where it needs to go and move the following sentence into the correct location. 
             Also need to determine if anything needs to be done to keep a pointer in this paragraph.
             
             This document defines a number of labels in the IANA “COSE Object Labels Registry” (defined in <xref target="IANA-Top-Level-Keys"/>).
        -->
      </t>

      <t>
        The set of labels present in a security object is not restricted to those defined in this document.
        However, it is not recommended that additional fields be added to a structure unless this is going to be done in a closed environment.
        When new fields need to be added, it is recommended that a new message type be created so that processing of the field can be ensured.
        Using an older structure with a new field means that any security properties of the new field will not be enforced.
        Before a new field is added at the outer level, strong consideration needs to be given to defining a new header field and placing it into the protected headers.
        Applications should make a determination if non-standardized fields are going to be permitted.
        It is suggested that libraries allow for an option to fail parsing if non-standardized fields exist, this is especially true if they do not allow for access to the fields in other ways.
      </t>

      <t>
        A label 'msg_type' is defined to distinguish between the different structures when they appear as part of a COSE_MSG object.
        <cref source="JLS">
          I have moved msg_type into the individual structures.
          However, they would not be necessary in the cases where a) the security service is known and b) security libraries can setup to take individual structures.
          Should they be moved back to just appearing if used in a COSE_MSG rather than on the individual structure?
        </cref>

          <t>1 - Signed Message.</t>

          <t>3 - Authenticated Message (MACed message)</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        Implementations MUST be prepared to find an integer under this label that does not correspond to the values 1 to 3.
        If this is found then the client MUST stop attempting to parse the structure and fail.
        The value of 0 is reserved and not to be used.
        If the value of 0 is found, then clients MUST fail processing the structure.
        Implementations need to recognize that the set of values might be extended at a later date, but they should not provide a security service based on guesses of what is there.
      </t>

      <t>
        NOTE:  Is there any reason to allow for a marker of a COSE_Key structure and allow it to be a COSE_MSG?
	Doing so does allow for a security risk, but may simplify the code.

        The top level of each of the COSE message structures are encoded as maps.
        We use an integer to distinguish between the different security message types.
        By searching for the integer under the label identified by msg_type (which is in turn an integer), one can determine which security message is being used and thus what syntax is for the rest of the elements in the map.

      <t>
        The structure of COSE has been designed to have two buckets of information that are not considered to be part of the payload itself, but are used for holding information about algorithms, keys, or evaluation hints for the  processing of the layer.
        These two buckets are available for use in all of the structures in this document except for keys.
        While these buckets can be present, they may not all be usable in all instances.
        For example, while the protected bucket is defined as part of recipient structures, most of the algorithms that are used for recipients do not provide the necessary functionality to provide the needed protection and thus the bucket should not be used.
      </t>

      <t>
        Both buckets are implemented as CBOR maps.
        The map key is a 'label' (<xref target="label"/>).
        The value portion is dependent on the definition for the label.
        Both maps use the same set of label/value pairs. 
        The integer range for labels has been divided into several sections with a standard range, a private range, and a range that is dependent on the algorithm selected.
        The defined labels can be found in the 'COSE Header Parameters' IANA registry (<xref target="cose-header-key-table"/>).

          A completest version of this grammar would list the options available in the protected and unprotected headers.

            contains parameters about the current layer that are to be cryptographically protected.
            This bucket MUST NOT be used if it is not going to be included in a cryptographic computation.
            This bucket is encoded in the message as a binary object.
            This value is obtained by CBOR encoding the protected map and wrapping it in a bstr object.
            This wrapping allows for the encoding of the protected map to be transported with a greater chance that it will not be altered in transit.
            (Badly behaved intermediates could decode and re-encode, but this will result in a failure to verify unless the re-encoded byte string is identical to the decoded byte string.)
            This finesses the problem of all parties needing to be able to do a common connical encoding.

          <t hangText='unprotected'>

          </t>
        </list>

        Only parameters that deal with the current layer are to be placed at that layer.
        As an example of this, the parameter 'content type' describes the content of the message being carried in the message.
        As such this parameter is placed only the the content layer and is not placed in the key managment or signature layers.
        In principle, one should be able to process any given layer without reference to any other layer.
        (The only data that should need to cross layers is the cryptographic key.)

        The presence of both buckets is optional, however the requirement that the 'alg' parameter be present at each level effectively imposes a requirement that one of the buckets will always be present.
        The parameters that go into the buckets come from the IANA "COSE Header Parameters" (<xref target="cose-header-key-table"/>).

    <section anchor="signing-structure" title="Signing Structure">

      <t>
        The signature structure allows for one or more signatures to be applied to a message payload.
        There are provisions for parameters about the content and parameters about the signature to be carried along with the signature itself.
        These parameters may be authenticated by the signature, or just present.
        Examples of parameters about the content would be the type of content, when the content was created, and who created the content.
        Examples of parameters about the signature would be the algorithm and key used to create the signature, when the signature was created, and counter-signatures.
      </t>

      <t>
        When more than one signature is present, the successful validation of one signature associated with a given signer is usually treated as a successful signature by that signer.
        However, there are some application environments where other rules are needed.
        An application that employs a rule other than one valid signature for each signer must specify those rules.
        Also, where simple matching of the signer identifier is not sufficient to determine whether the signatures were generated by the same signer, the application specification must describe how to determine which signatures were generated by the same signer.
        Support of different communities of recipients is the primary reason that signers choose to include more than one signature.
        For example, the COSE_Sign structure might include signatures generated with the RSA signature algorithm and with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature algorithm.
        This allows recipients to verify the signature associated with one algorithm or the other.

      <section title="Externally Supplied Data" anchor="Extern_AAD">
        <t>
          One of the features that we supply in the COSE document is the ability for applications to provide additional data to be authenticated as part of the security, but that is not carried as part of the COSE object.
          The primary reason for supporting this can be seen by looking at the CoAP message struture <xref target="RFC7252"/> where the facility exists for options to be carried before the payload.
          An example of data that can be placed in this location would be transaction ids and nonces to check for replay protection.
          If the data is in the options section, then it is available for routers to help in performing the replay detection and prevention.
          However, it may also be desired to protect these values so that they cannot be modified in transit.
          This is the purpose of the externally supplied data field.
        </t>

        <t>
          This document describes the process for using a byte array of externally supplied authenticated data, however the method of constructing the byte array is a function of the application.
          Applications which use this feature need to define how the externally supplied authenticated data is to be constructed.
          Such a construction needs to take into account the following issues:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              If multiple items are included, care needs to be taken that data cannot bleed between the items.
              This is usually addressed by making fields fixed width and/or encoding the length of the field.
              Using options from CoAP as an example, these fields use a TLV structure so they can be concatenated without any problems.
            </t>
            <t>
              If multiple items are included, a defined order for the items needs to be defined.
              Using options from CoAP as an example, an application could state that the fields are to be ordered by the option number.

      <t>
        In this section we describe the structure and methods to be used when doing an encryption in COSE.
        In COSE, we use the same techniques and structures for encrypting both the plain text and the keys used to protect the text.
        This is different from the approach used by both <xref target="RFC5652"/> and <xref target="RFC7516"/> where different structures are used for the plain text and for the different key management techniques.
      </t>

      <t>
        One of the byproducts of using the same technique for encrypting and encoding both the content and the keys using the various key management techniques, is a requirement that all of the key management techniques use an Authenticated Encryption (AE) algorithm. 
        (For the purpose of this document we use a slightly loose definition of AE algorithms.)
        When encrypting the plain text, it is normal to use an Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) algorithm. 
        For key management, either AE or AEAD algorithms can be used.
        See <xref target="AE-algo"/> for more details about the different types of algorithms.

          A typical encrypted message consists of an encrypted content and an encrypted CEK for one or more recipients.
          The content-encryption key is encrypted for each recipient.
          The details of this encryption depends on the key management technique used, but the six generally techniques are:

      <t>
        In this section we describe the structure and methods to be used when doing MAC authentication in COSE. 
        This document allows for the use of all of the same methods of key management as are allowed for encryption.
      </t>

      <t>
        When using MAC operations, there are two modes in which it can be used. 
        The first is just a check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was computed. 
        Any of the key management methods can be used for this purpose. 
        The second mode is to both check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was computed, and to use key management to verify who sent it. 
        The key management modes that support this are ones that either use a pre-shared secret, or do static-static key agreement. 
        In both of these cases the entity MACing the message can be validated by a key binding. 
        (The binding of identity assumes that there are only two parties involved and you did not send the message yourself.)

    <section title="Signature Algorithms">
      <t>
        There are two basic signature algorithm structures that can be used.
        The first is the common signature with appendix.
        In this structure, the message content is processed and a signature is produced, the signature is called the appendix.
        This is the message structure used by our common algorithms such as ECDSA and RSASSA-PSS.
        (In fact two of the letters in RSASSA-PSS are signature appendix.)
        The basic structure becomes:
      </t>
      <figure><artwork>
        <![CDATA[
signature = Sign(message content, key)

valid = Verification(message content, key, signature)
]]>
      </artwork></figure>
      
      <t>
        The second is a signature with message recovery.
        (An example of such an algorithm is [TBD].)
        In this structure, the message content is processed, but part of is included in the signature.
        Moving bytes of the message content into the signature allows for an effectively smaller signature, the signature size is still potentially large, but the message content is shrunk.
        This has implications for systems implementing these algoritms and for applications that use them.
        The first is that the message content is not fully available until after a signature has been validated.
        Until that point the part of the message contained inside of the signature is unrecoverable.
        The second is that the security analysis of the strength of the signature is very much based on the structure of the message content.
        Messages which are highly predictable require additional randomness to be supplied as part of the signature process, in the worst case it because the same as doing a singature with appendix.
        Thirdly, in the event that multple signatures are applied to a message, all of the signature algorithms are going to be required to consume the same number of bytes of message content.

        At this time, only signatures with appendixes are defined for use with COSE, however considerable interest has been expressed in using a signature with message recovery algorithm due to the effective size reduction that is possible.
        Implementations will need to keep this in mind for later possible integration.

        <t>
          The security strength of the signature is no greater than the minimum of the security strength associated with the bit length of the key and the security strength of the hash function.
          When a hash function is used that has greater security than is provided by the length of the key, the signature algorithm uses the leftmost key length bits of the hash function output.

          In order to promote interoperability, it is suggested that SHA-256 be used only with keys of length 256, SHA-384 be used only with keys of length 384 and SHA-512 be used only with keys of length 521.
          This is aligned with the recommendation in Section 4 of <xref target="RFC5480"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          The signature algorithm results in a pair of integers (R, S).
          These integers will be of the same order as length of the key used for the signature process.
          The signature is encoded by converting the integers into byte strings of the same length as the key size.
          The length is rounded up to the nearest byte and is left padded with zero bits to get to the correct length.
          The two integers are then concatenated together to form a byte string that is the resulting signature.
        </t>

        <t>
          Using the function defined in <xref target="RFC3447"/> the signature is:
          <vspace/>
          Signature = I2OSP(R, n) | I2OSP(S, n)

            On of the issues that needs to be discussed is substitution attacks.
            There are two different things that can potentially be substituted in this algorithm.
            Both of these attacks are current theoretical only.
          </t>
          
          <t>
            The first substitution attack is changing the curve used to validate the signature, the only requirement is that the order of the key match the length of R and S.
            It is theoretically possible to use a different curve and get a different result.
            We current do not have any way to deal with this version of the attack except to restrict the overall set of curves that can be used.
          </t>

          <t>
            The second substitution attack is to change the hash function that is used to verify the signature.
            This attack can be mitigated by including the signature algorithm identifier in the data to be signed.

      <t>
        Message Authentication Codes (MACs) provide data authentication and integrity protection.
        They provide either no or very limited data origination.
        (One cannot, for example, be used to prove the identity of the sender to a third party.)
      </t>

      <t>
        MAC algorithms can be based on either a block cipher algorithm (i.e. AES-MAC) or a hash algorithm (i.e. HMAC).
        This document defines a MAC algorithm for each of these two constructions.
      </t>

      <section title="Hash-based Message Authentication Codes (HMAC)">
        <t>
          The Hash-base Message Authentication Code algorithm (HMAC) <xref target="RFC2104"/><xref target="RFC4231"/> was designed, in part, to deal with the birthday attacks on straight hash functions.
          The algorithm was also designed to all for new hash algorithms to be directly plugged in without changes to the hash function.
          The HMAC design process has been vindicated as, while the security of hash algorithms such as MD5 has decreased over time, the security of HMAC combined with MD5 has not yet been shown to be compromised <xref target="RFC6151"/>.
        </t>

        <t>
          For use in constrained environments, we define a set of HMAC algorithms that are truncated.
          There are currently no known issues when truncating, however the security strength of the message tag is correspondingly reduced in strength.
          When truncating, the left most tag length bits are kept and transmitted.

      <section title="AES CCM">
        <t>
          Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) is a generic authentication encryption block cipher mode defined in <xref target="RFC3610"/>.
          The CCM mode is combined with the AES block encryption algorithm to define a commonly used content encryption algorithm used in constrainted devices.
        </t>

        <t>
          The CCM mode has two parameter choices.
          The first choice is M, the size of the authentication field.
          The choice of the value for M involves a trade-off between message expansion and the probably that an attacker can undetecably modify a message.
          
          The second choice is L, the size of the length field.
          This value requires a trade-off between the maximum message size and the size of the Nonce.
        </t>

        <t>
          It is unfortunate that the specification for CCM specified L and M as a count of bytes rather than a count of bits.
          This leads to possible misunderstandings where AES-CCM-8 is frequently used to refer to a version of CCM mode where the size of the authentication is 64-bits and not 8-bits.
          These values have traditionally been specified as bit counts rather than byte counts.
          This document will follow the tradition of using bit counts so that it is easier to compare the different algorithms presented in this document.
        </t>

        <t>
          We define a matrix of algorithms in this document over the values of L and M.
          Constrained devices are usually operating in situations where they use short messages and want to avoid doing key management operations.
          This favors smaller values of M and larger values of L.
          Less constrained devices do will want to be able to user larger messages and are more willing to generate new keys for every operation.
          This favors larger values of M and smaller values of L.
          (The use of a large nonce means that random generation of both the key and the nonce will decrease the chances of repeating the pair on two different messages.)
        </t>

        <t>
          The following values are used for L:
          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="16-bits (2)">
              limits messages to 2^16 bytes (64Kbyte) in length.
              This sufficently long for messages in the constrainted world.
              The nonce length is 13 bytes allowing for 2^(13*8) possible values of the nonce without repeating.
            </t>
            <t hangText="64-bits (8)"> 
              limits messages to 2^64 byes in length.
              The nonce length is 7 bytes allowing for 2^56 possible values of the nonce without repeating.
            </t>
          </list>

            <xref target="RFC3610"/> additionally calls out one other consideration of note.
            It is possible to do a pre-computation attack against the algorithm in cases where the portions encryption content is highly predictable.
            This reduces the security of the key size by half.
            Ways to deal with this attack include adding a random portion to the nonce value and/or increasing the key size used.
            Using a portion of the nonce for a random value will decrease the number of messages that a single key can be used for.
            Increasing the key size may require more resources in the constrained device.

              This parameter is protected by being included in the key computation and does not need to be separately authenticated.

      <section title="Context Information Structure" anchor="context">
        <t>
          The context information structure is used to ensure that the derived keying material is "bound" to the context of the transaction.
          The context information structure used here is based on that defined in <xref target="SP800-56A"/>.
          By using CBOR for the encoding of the context information structure, we automatically get the same type of type and length separation of fields that is obtained by the use of ASN.1.
          This means that there is no need to encode the lengths for the base elements as it is done by the CBOR encoding.
        </t>

        <t>
          The context information structure refers to PartyU and PartyV as the two parties which are doing the key derivation.
          Unless the application protocol defines differently, we assign PartyU to the entity that is creating the message and PartyV to the entity that is receiving the message.
          This is because we are assuming a set of stand alone store and forward messaging processes.
        </t>

        <t>
          Application protocols are free to define the roles differently.
          For example, they could assign the PartyU role to the entity that initiates the connection and allow directly sending multiple messages over the line without changing the role information.
        </t>
        
        <t>
          We encode the context specific information using a CBOR array type.
          The fields in the array are:

          <list style="hanging">
            <t hangText="AlgorithmID">
              This field indicates the algorithm for which the key material will be used.
              This field is required to be present and is a copy of the algorithm identifier in the message.
              The field exists in the context information so that if the same environment is used for different algorithms, then completely different keys will be generated each of those algorithms.
              (This practice means if algorithm A uses a shorter key than algorithm B and thus can be found easier, the key derived for algorithm B will not contain the key for algorithm A as a prefix.)
              <cref source="JLS">
                Unless key material is being derived for multiple items (i.e both a key and an IV) this will be the COSE algorithm value.
                Even then it might still be the COSE algorithm value, it is just a requirement for a new algorithm.
                Do we want to have the ability to derive both the key and a partial IV for CCM?
              </cref>
            </t>

            <t hangText="PartyUInfo">
              This field holds information about party U.
              The ParytUInfo structure is divided into three pieces:
              
              <list style="hanging">
                <t hangText="identity">
                  This contains the identity information for party U.
                  The identities can be assigned in one of two manners.
                  Firstly, a protocol can assign identities based on roles.
                  For example, the roles of "client" and "server" may be assigned to different entities in the protocol.
                  Each entity would then use the correct label for the data they they send or receive.
                  The second way is for a protocol to assign identities is to use a name based on a naming system (i.e. DNS, X.509 names).
                  <vspace/>
                  We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU identity' that can be used to carry identity information in the message.
                  However, identity information is often known as part of the protocol and can thus be inferred rather than made explicit.
                  If identity information is carried in the message, applications SHOULD have a way of validating the supplied identity information.
                  The identity information does not need to be specified and can be left as absent.
                  <vspace/>
                  The identity value supplied will be validated as part of the key derivation process.
                  If the identity string is wrong, then the wrong key will be created.
                </t>

                  This contains a one time nonce value.
                  The nonce can either be implicit from the protocol or carried as a value in the unprotected headers.

                  <vspace/>
                  We define an algorithm parameter 'PartyU nonce' that can be used to carry this value in the message

    <section title="Key Management Algorithms" anchor="key-management-algs">
      <t>
        There are a number of different key management methods that can be used in the COSE encryption system.
        In this section we will discuss each of the key management methods, what fields need to be specified, and which algorithms are defined in this document to deal with each of them.
      </t>

      <t>
        The names of the key management methods used here are the same as are defined in <xref target="RFC7517"/>.
        Other specifications use different terms for the key management methods or do not support some of the key management methods.
      </t>

      <t>
        At the moment we do not have any key management methods that allow for the use of protected headers. 
        This may be changed in the future if, for example, the AES-GCM Key wrap method defined in <xref target="RFC7518"/> were extended to allow for authenticated data. 
        In that event, the use of the 'protected' field, which is current forbidden below, would be permitted.
      </t>

      <section title="Direct Encryption">
          <t>
            In direct encryption mode, a shared secret between the sender and the recipient is used as the key.
            When direct encryption mode is used, it MUST be the only mode used on the message.
            It is a massive security leak to have both direct encryption and a different key management mode on the same message.
          </t>

          <t>
            For JOSE, direct encryption key management is the only key management method allowed for doing MACed messages.
            In COSE, all of the key management methods can be used for MACed messages.
          </t>

          <t>

                At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg' parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the shared secret.

                  There are no algorithm parameters defined for this key management methods.
                </t>

                <t hangText="Direct KDF:">
                  This key managment takes a common shared secret between the two parties and applies the HKDF function (<xref target="HKDF"/>) using the context structure defined in <xref target="context"/> to transform the shared secret into the necessary key.
                  Either the 'salt' parameter of HKDF or the partyU 'nonce' parameter of the context structure MUST be present.
                  This parameter can be generated either randomly or deterministically, the requirement is that it be a unique value for the key pair in question.
                  <vspace/>
                  If the salt/nonce value is generated randomly, then it is suggested that the length of the random value be the same length as the hash function underlying HKDF, i.e 256-bits.
                  While there is no way to guarantee that it will be unique, there is a high probability that it will be unique.
                  If the salt/nonce value is generated deterministically, it can be guaranteed to be unique and thus there is no length requirement.

      <section title="Key Wrapping">
        <t>
          In key wrapping mode, the CEK is randomly generated and that key is then encrypted by a shared secret between the sender and the recipient.
          All of the currently defined key wrapping algorithms for JOSE (and thus for COSE) are AE algorithms.
          Key wrapping mode is considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any capability for doing random key generation.
          This is because the shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data  has some degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.

            The AES Key Wrapping algorithm is defined in <xref target="RFC3394"/>.
            This algorithm uses an AES key to wrap a value that is a multiple of 64-bits, as such it can be used to wrap a key for any of the content encryption algorithms defined in this document.

            The defintion of RSAEA-OAEP can be find in Section 7.1 of <xref target="RFC3447"/>.
            The algorithm is parameterized using a masking generation function (mgf), a hash function (h) and encoding parameters (P).
            For the algoithm identifiers defined in this section:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>mgf is always set to MFG1 from <xref target="RFC3447"/> and uses the same hash function as h.</t>
              <t>P is always set to the empty octet string.</t>
            </list>
            <xref target="table-RSA-OAEP"/> summarizes the rest of the values.

              A key size of 2048 bits or larger MUST be used with these algorithms.
              This key size corresponds roughly to the same strength as provided by a 128-bit symmetric encryption algorithm.
            </t>

            <t>
              It is highly recommended that checks on the key length  be done before starting a decryption operation.
              One potential denial of service operation is to provide encrypted objects using either abnormally long or oddly sized RSA modulus values.
              Implementations SHOULD be able to encrypt and decrypt with modulus between 2048 and 16K bits in length.<cref source="JLS">Is this range we want to specify?</cref>
              Applications can impose additional restrictions on the length of the modulus.

      <section title="Direct Key Agreement">
        <t>
          When using the 'Direct Key Agreement' key managment method, the two parties use a key agreement method to create a shared secret.
          A KDF is then applied to the shared secret to derive a key to be used in protecting the data.
          This key is normally used as a CEK or MAC key, but could be used for other purposes if more than two layers are in use (see <xref target="three-layer"/>).
        </t>

        <t>
          The most commonly used key agreement algorithm used is Diffie-Hellman, but other variants exist.
          Since COSE is designed for a store and forward environment rather than an on-line environment, many of the DH variants cannot be used as the receiver of the message cannot provide any key material.
          One side-effect of this is that perfect forward security is not achievable, a static key will always be used for the receiver of the COSE message.
        </t>

        <t>
          Two variants of DH that are easily supported are:
          <list>
            <t>
              Ephemeral-Static DH: where the sender of the message creates a one time DH key and uses a static key for the recipient.
              The use of the ephemeral sender key means that no additional random input is needed as this is randomly generated for each message.
            </t>
            <t>
              Static-Static DH: where a static key is used for both the sender and the recipient.
              The use of static keys allows for recipient to get a weak version of data origination for the message.
              When static-static key agreement is used, then some piece of unique data is require to ensure that a different key is created for each message
            </t>
          </list>
          In this specification, both variants are specified.
          This has been done to provide the weak data origination option for use with MAC operations.
        </t>

        <t>
          When direct key agreement mode is used, it MUST be the only key management mode used on the message and there MUST be only one recipient.
          This method creates the key directly and that makes it difficult to mix with additional recipients.
          If multiple recipients are needed, then the version with key wrap (<xref target="ECDH-KeyWrap"/>) needs to be used.
        </t>

        <t>
          The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:
        </t>

        <t>
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              The 'protected' field MUST be absent.
            </t>
            <t>
              At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'alg' parameter and SHOULD contain a parameter identifying the recipient's asymmetric key.
            </t>
            <t>
              The 'unprotected' field MUST contain the 'epk' parameter.

            We define one set of key agreement algorithms structured around Elliptic Curves Diffie-Hellman problem.

            We define both an ephemeral-static and a static-static version of these algorithms.
            We allow for multiple curves to be used, it needs to be noted that the math required for the curves as well as the point representation is going to be different.
            <cref source="JLS">
              This could just as easily be done by specifying two different set of algorithm identifiers, one for each of the key formats.
              I don't believe that we need to set things up by having two different sets of algorithm identifiers for the different keys as the structure of what is represented is going to be the same, just the math and point formats are going to be different.
              The other "difference" is the question of how the octet string of the shared secret is defined. 
              However, since we don't need to specify either in this document we can defer both of them into their respective documents.

        The COSE_Key object defines a way to hold a single key object, it is still required that the members of individual key types be defined.
        This section of the document is where we define an initial set of members for specific key types.

      <t>
        For each of the key types, we define both public and private members.
        The public members are what is transmitted to others for their usage.
        We define private members mainly for the purpose of archival of keys by individuals.
        However, there are some circumstances where private keys may be distributed by various entities in a protocol.
        Examples include:  Entities which have poor random number generation.
        Centralized key creation for multi-cast type operations.
        Protocols where a shared secret is used as a bearer token for authorization purposes.
      </t>

        Keys are identified by the 'kty' member of the COSE_Key object.

          Two different key structures are being defined for Elliptic Curve keys.
          One version uses both an x and a y coordinate, potentially with point compression.
          This is the traditional EC point representation that is used in <xref target="RFC5480"/>.
          The other version uses only the x coordinate as the y coordinate is either to be recomputed or not needed for the key agreement operation.
          An example of this is Curve25519 <xref target="I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves"/>.

            The traditional way of sending EC curves has been to send either both the x and y coordinates, or the x coordinate and a sign bit for the y coordinate.
            The latter encoding has not been recommend in the IETF due to potential IPR issues with Certicom.
            However, for operations in constrained environments, the ability to shrink a message by not sending the y coordinate is potentially useful.

          This document defines a key structure for both the public and private halves of RSA keys.
          Together, an RSA public key and an RSA private key form an RSA key pair.
          <cref source="JLS">
            Looking at the CBOR specification, the bstr that we are looking in our table below should most likely be specified as big numbers rather than as binary strings.
            This means that we would use the tag 6.2 instead.
            From my reading of the specification, there is no difference in the encoded size of the resulting output.
            The specification of bignum does explicitly allow for integers encoded with leading zeros.

          The document also provides support for the so-called "multi-prime" RSA where the modulus may have more than two prime factors.
          The benefit of multi-prime RSA is lower computational cost for the decryption and signature primitives.
          For a discussion on how multi-prime affects the security of RSA crypto-systems, the reader is referred to <xref target="MultiPrimeRSA"/>.

          This document follows the naming convention of <xref target="RFC3447"/> for the naming of the fields of an RSA public or private key.
          The table <xref target="table-rsa-keys"/> provides a summary of the label values and the types associated with each of those labels.
          The requirements for fields for RSA keys are as follows:
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              For all keys, 'kty' MUST be present and MUST have a value of 3.

            <t>
              For public keys, the fields 'n' and 'e' MUST be present. 
              All other fields defined in <xref target="table-rsa-keys"/> MUST be absent.
            </t>
            <t>
              For private keys with two primes, the fields 'other', 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i' MUST be absent, all other fields MUST be present.
            </t>
            <t>
              For private keys with more than two primes, all fields MUST  be present. 
              For the third to nth primes, each of the primes is represented as a map containing the fields 'r_i', 'd_i' and 't_i'. 
              The field 'other' is an array of those maps.

    <section anchor="AE-algo" title="AEAD and AE algorithms">

      <t>
        The set of encryption algorithms that can be used with this
        specification is restricted to authenticated encryption (AE) and
        authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithms.
        This means that there is a strong check that the data decrypted by the
        recipient is the same as what was encrypted by the sender.
        Encryption modes such as counter have no check on this at all.
        The CBC encryption mode had a weak check that the data is correct,
        given a random key and random data, the CBC padding check will pass
        one out of 256 times.
        There have been several times that a normal encryption mode has been
        combined with an integrity check to provide a content encryption mode
        that does provide the necessary authentication.
        AES-GCM <xref target="AES-GCM"/>, AES-CCM <xref target="RFC3610"/>, AES-CBC-HMAC
        <xref target="I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2"/> are  examples of these composite
        modes.
      </t>

      <t>
        PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport does not qualify as an AE algorithm.
        There are only three bytes in the encoding that can be checked as
        having decrypted correctly, the rest of the content can only be
        probabilistically checked as having decrypted correctly.
        For this reason, PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport MUST NOT be used with
        this specification.
        RSA-OAEP was designed to have the necessary checks that that content
        correctly decrypted and does qualify as an AE algorithm.
      </t>

      <t>
        When dealing with authenticated encryption algorithms, there is always some type of value that needs to be checked to see if the authentication level has passed.
        This authentication value may be:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A separately generated tag computed by both the encrypter and decrypter and then compared by the decryptor.
            This tag value may be either placed at the end of the cipher text (the decision we made) or kept separately (the decision made by the JOSE working group).
            This is the approach followed by AES-GCM <xref target="AES-GCM"/> and AES-CCM <xref target="RFC3610"/>.
            <!-- Mike Jones:  Last sentence is not clear.  He is reading this as referring to ? rather than just being generating a tag. - M00TODO -->
          </t>
          <t>
            A fixed value that is part of the encoded plain text.
            This is the approach followed by the AES key wrap algorithm <xref target="RFC3394"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
            A computed value is included as part of the encoded plain text.
            The computed value is then checked by the decryptor using the same computation path.
            This is the approach followed by RSAES-OAEP <xref target="RFC3447"/>.

    <section anchor="three-layer" title="Three Levels of Recipient Information">

      <t>
        All of the currently defined Key Management methods only use two levels of the COSE_Encrypt structure.
        The first level is the message content and the second level is the content key encryption.
        However, if one uses a key management technique such as RSA-KEM (see Appendix A of RSA-KEM <xref target="RFC5990"/>, then
        it make sense to have three levels of the COSE_Encrypt structure.
      </t>

      <t>
        These levels would be:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Level 0: The content encryption level.  This level contains the payload of the message.
          </t>
          <t>
            Level 1: The encryption of the CEK by a KEK.
          </t>
          <t>
            Level 2: The encryption of a long random secret using an RSA key and a key derivation function to convert that secret into the KEK.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        This is an example of what a triple layer message would look like.
        The message has the following layers:

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Level 0: Has a content encrypted with AES-GCM using a 128-bit key.
          </t>
          <t>
            Level 1: Uses the AES Key wrap algorithm with a 128-bit key.
          </t>
          <t>
            Level 3: Uses ECDH Ephemeral-Static direct to generate the level 1 key.
          </t>
        </list>

        In effect this example is a decomposed version of using the ECDH-ES+A128KW algorithm.

        The examples can be found at https://github.com/cose-wg/Examples.  I am currently still in the process of getting the examples up there along with some control information for people to be able to check and reproduce the examples.

      <t>
        Examples may have some features that are in questions but not yet incorporated in the document.
      </t>

      <t>
        To make it easier to read, the examples are presented using the CBOR's diagnostic notation rather than a binary dump.
        <cref source="JLS">
          Do we want to keep this as diagnostic notation or should we switch to having "binary" examples instead?
        </cref>
        Using the Ruby based CBOR diagnostic tools at ????, the diagnostic notation can be converted into binary files using the following command line:
        (install command is?...)

                In this case the length of the key to be used is implicit rather than explicit.
                This needs to be the case because a direct key could be any length, however it means that when the key is derived, there is currently nothing to state how long the derived key needs to be.
