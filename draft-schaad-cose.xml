    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
        The JOSE working group produced a set of documents that defined how to perform encryption, signatures and message authentication (MAC) operations for JSON documents and then to encode the results using the JSON format <xref target="RFC7159"/>.
        This document does the same work for use with the CBOR <xref target="RFC7049"/> document format.
        While there is a strong attempt to keep the flavor of the original JOSE documents, two considerations are taking into account:
        <list>
          <t>
            CBOR has capabilities that are not present in JSON and should be used.
            One example of this is the fact that CBOR has a method of encoding binary directly without first converting it into a base64 encoded sting.
          </t>
          <t>
            The authors did not always agree with some of the decisions made by the JOSE working group.
            Many of these decisions have been re-examined, and where it seems to the authors to be superior, replaced.
          </t>
        </list>
      </t>

          <list style="symbols">
            <t>
              We switched from using a map to using an array at the message level.
              While this change means that it is no longer possible to add new information in the form of new fields to the message object, this ability is still there as this data can be added to the protected and unprotected maps.

      <section title="CBOR Grammar">
        <t>
          There currently is no standard CBOR grammar available for use by specifications.
          In this document, we use a modified version of the CBOR data definition language (CDDL) defined in <xref target="I-D.greevenbosch-appsawg-cbor-cddl"/>.
          The differences between the defined grammar and the one we used are mostly self explanatory.
          The biggest difference being the addition of the choice operator '|'.

    <section title="The COSE_MSG structure">
      <t>
        The COSE_MSG structure is a top level CBOR object which corresponds to the DataContent type in <xref target="CMS"/>.
        This structure allows for a top level message to be sent which could be any of the different security services, where the security service is identified.
        The presence of this structure does not preclude a protocol to use one of the individual structures as a stand alone component.

    <section title="Encryption object">
      <t>
        In this section we describe the structure and methods to be used when doing an encryption in COSE.
        In COSE, we use the same techniques and structures for encrypting both the plain text and the keys used to protect the text.
        This is different from the approach used by both <xref target="CMS"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-encryption"/> where different structures are used both for the plain text and for the different key management techniques.
      </t>
        
      <t>
        One of the by products of using the same technique for encrypting and encoding bot the content and the keys using the various key managment techniques, is a requirement that all of the key management techniques use an Authenticated Encryption (AE) algorithm.
        When encrypting the plain text, it is normal to use an Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) algorithm.  For key management, either AE or AEAD algorithms can be used.
        See <xref target="AE-algo"/> for more details about the different types of algorithms.
      </t>

      <t>
        The structure has two maps where data about the content can be placed.
        The data placed here is also the data which is used to control how the decryption is to be done for this object.
        When data is placed in these two structures, it is extremely poor practice to have data which is applicable to a different level.
        For example, the unprotected field at the level of a key management decryption should not contain information either about how to interpret the plain text (i.e. content type) or how to convert the cipher text back to plain text (i.e. the kid for the recipient).
      </t>

      <figure>
      <artwork>
COSE_encrypt {
  protected : bstr | null;   # Contains map(tstr)
  unprotected : map(tstr) | null;
  iv : bstr | null;

  tag : bstr;
  recipients : COSE_encrypt_a* | null;
}

* COSE_encrypt_a : COSE_encrypt

      <t>
        Description of the fields:

        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="protected">
            contains the information about the plain text or encryption process that is to be integrity protected.
            The field is encoded in CBOR as a 'bstr' if present and the value 'null' if there is no data.
            The contents of the protected field is a CBOR map of the protected data names and values.
            The map is CBOR encoded before placing it into the bstr.
          </t>
          <t hangText="unprotected">
            contains infomration about the plain text that is not integrity protected.
            If there are no field, then the value 'null' is used.
          </t>
          <t hangText="iv">
            contains the initialization vector (IV), or it's equivalent, if one is needed by the encryption algorithm.
            If there is no IV, then the value 'null' is used.
          </t>
          <t hangText="aad">
            contains additional authenticated data (aad) supplied by the application.
            This field contains information about the plain text data that is authenticated, but not encrypted.
            If the application does not provide this data, the value 'null' is used.
          </t>
          <t hangText="cipherText">
            contains the encrypted plain text.
            If the cipherText is to be transported independently of the control information about the encryption process (i.e. detached content) then the value 'null' is encoded here.
          </t>
          <t hangText="tag">
            <cref source="JLS">Is life easier if this goes away and becomes part of the cipher text?</cref>
          </t>
          <t hangText="recipients">
            contains the recipient information.
            The field is an array of elements, one for each recipient.
            If there is no recipient information, the value 'null' is used.
            
            <cref source="JLS"> 
              Is there a reason to do a flatten on the recipient array?
              This is easier if we make the recipient structure a map as it becomes a difference between array vs map as the next item down.
              If we flatten for arrays, then it because a question of checking - "array, bstr" vs "array, array, bstr".  
              I don't know how hard this is to deal with.
              We can also do the flattening in a different way as we can look at the length of the array if we just append the recipient vs doing an array of recipients.
              I think this would work.
              Implies the rule:  recipients : COSE_encrypt | COSE_encrypt_a* | null;

      <section title="Key Management Methods">
        <t>
          There are a number of different key management methods that can be used in the COSE encryption system.
          In this section we will discuss each of the key management methods and what fields need to be specified to deal with each of them.
        </t>

        <t>
          The names of the key management methods used here are the same as are defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-jose-json-web-key"/>.
          Other specifications use different terms for the key management methods or do not support some of the key management methods.
        </t>

        <section title="Direct Encryption">
          <t>
            In direct encryption mode, a shared secret between the sender and the recipient is used as the CEK.
            For direct encryption mode, no recipient structure is built.
            All of the information about the key is placed in either the protected or unprotected fields at the content level.
            When direct encryption mode is used, it MUST be the only mode used on the message.
            It is a massive security leak to have both direct encryption and a different key management mode on the same message.
          </t>

          <t>
            For JOSE, direct encryption key management is the only key management method allowed for doing MAC-ed messages.
            In COSE, all of the key management methods can be used for MAC-ed messages.
          </t>

          <t>
            The COSE_encrypt structure for the recipient is organized as follows:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>The 'protected', 'iv', 'aad', 'ciphertext' and 'recipients' fields MUST be null.</t>
              <t>The plain text to be encrypted is the key from next layer down (usually the content layer).</t>
              <t>At a minimum, the 'unprotected' field SHOULD contain the 'alg' parameter as well as a parameter identifying the shared secret.</t>
            </list>
          </t>

        </section>

        <section title="Key Wrapping">
          <t>
            In key wrapping mode, the CEK is randomly generated and that key is then encrypted by a shared secret between the sender and the recipient.
            All of the currently defined key wrapping algorithms for JOSE (and thus for COSE) are AE algorithms.
            Key wrapping mode is considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any capability for doing random key generation.
            This is because the shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data  has some degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.

        </section>

        <section title="Key Encryption">
          <t>
            Key Encryption mode is also called key transport mode in some standards.
            Key Encryption mode differs from Key Wrap mode in that it uses an asymmetric encryption algorithm rather than a symmetric encryption algorithm to protect the key.
            The only current Key Encryption mode algorithm supported is RSAES-OAEP.

                This change in encoded is due to the fact that frequently, values such as a hash of the public key is used for a kid value.

      <t>
        The set of encryption algorithms that can be used with this specification is restricted to authenticated encryption (AE) and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithms.
        This means that there is a strong check that the data decrypted by the recipient is the same as what was encrypted by the sender.
        Encryption modes such as counter have no check on this at all.
        The CBC encryption mode had a weak check that the data is correct, given a random key and random data, the CBC padding check will pass one out of 256 times.
        There have been several times that a normal encryption mode has been combined with an integrity check to provide a content encryption mode that does provide the necessary authentication.
        AES-GCM <xref target="AES-GCM"/>, AES-CCM <xref target="RFC3610"/>, AES-CBC-HMAC <xref target="I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2"/> are  examples of these composite modes.
      </t>

      <t>
        PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport does not qualify as an AE algorithm.  
        There are only three bytes in the encoding that can be checked as having decrypted correctly, the rest of the content can only be probabilistically checked as having decrypted correctly.
        For this reason, PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport MUST NOT be used with this specification.
        RSA-OAEP was designed to have the necessary checks that that content correctly decrypted and does qualify as an AE algorithm.
      </t>

      <t>
        When dealing with authenticated encryption algorithms, there is always some type of value that needs to be checked to see if the authentication level has passed.
        This authentication value may be:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            A separately generated tag computed by both the encrypter and decrypter and then compared by the decryptor.
            This tag value may be either placed at the end of the cipher text (the decision we made) or kept separately (the decision made by the JOSE working group).
            This is the approach followed by AES-GCM <xref target="AES-GCM"/> and AES-CCM <xref target="RFC3610"/>.
          </t>

          <t>
            A fixed value which is part of the encoded plain text.
            This is the approach followed by the AES key wrap algorithm <xref target="RFC3394"/>.
          </t>

          <t>
            A computed value is included as part of the encoded plain text.
            The computed value is then checked by the decryptor using the same computation path.
            This is the approach followed by RSAES-OAEP <xref target="RFC3447"/>.
