      <t>Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) is data format designed for small code size and small message size.  There is a need for the ability to have the basic security services defined for this data format.  This document specifies how to do signatures, message authentication codes and encryption using this data format.  The work in this document is derived in part from the JSON web security documents using the same parameters and algorithm identifiers as they do.</t>

      <t>The JOSE working group produced a set of documents that defined how to perform encryption, signatures and message authentication (MAC) operations for JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) documents and then to encode the results using the JSON format <xref target="RFC7159" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  This document does the same work for use with the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) <xref target="RFC7049" pageno="false" format="default"/> document format.  While there is a strong attempt to keep the flavor of the original JOSE documents, two considerations are taking into account:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>CBOR has capabilities that are not present in JSON and should be used.  One example of this is the fact that CBOR has a method of encoding binary directly without first converting it into a base64 encoded sting.</t>
          <t>The authors did not always agree with some of the decisions made by the JOSE working group.  Many of these decisions have been re-examined, and where it seems to the authors to be superior or simpler, replaced.</t>

      <t>The COSE_MSG structure is a top level CBOR object which corresponds to the DataContent type in <xref target="RFC5652" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  This structure allows for a top level message to be sent which could be any of the different security services, where the security service is identified.  The presence of this structure does not preclude a protocol to use one of the individual structures as a stand alone component.</t>

      <t>The top level of each of the COSE message structures are encoded as arrays.<vspace blankLines="0"/> We use an integer to distingish bettwen the different security message types.  By looking at the integer in the first element, one can determine which security message is being used and thus what the syntax is for the rest of the elements in the array.</t>
      <t>Implementations SHOULD be prepared to find an integer in the location which does not correspond to the values 1 to 3.  If this is found then the client MUST stop attempting to parse the structure and fail.  Clients need to recognize that the set of values could be extended at a later date, but should not provide a security service based on guesses of what is there.</t>

    <section anchor="header-parameters" title="Header Parameters" toc="default">
      <t>The structure of COSE has been designed to have two buckets of information that are not considered to be part of the message structure itself, but are used for holding information about algorithms, keys, or evaluation hints for the  processing of the layer.  These two buckets are available for use in all of the structures in this document except for keys.  While these buckets can be present, they may not all be usable in all instances. For example, while the protected bucket is present for recipient structures, most of the algorithms that are-used for recipients do not provide the necessary functionality to provide the needed protection and thus the element is not used.</t>
      <t>Both buckets are implemented as CBOR maps.  The maps can be keyed by negative integers, unsigned integers and strings.  The negative and unsigned integers are used for compactness of encoding.  The value portion is dependent on the key definition. Both maps use the same set of key/value pairs.  The integer key range has been divided into several sections with a standard range, a private range, and a range that is dependent on the algorithm selected.  The tables of keys defined can be found in <xref target="Header-Table" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>Two buckets are provided for each layer:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="protected">contains attributes about the layer which are to be cryptographically protected.  This bucket MUST NOT be used if it is not going to be included in a cryptographic computation.</t>
          <t hangText="unprotected">contains attributes about the layer which are not cryptographically protected.</t>

    <section anchor="signing-structure" title="Signing Structure" toc="default">
      <t>The signature structure allows for one or more signatures to be applied to a message payload.  There are provisions for  attributes about the content and attributes about the signature to be carried along with the signature itself.  These attributes may be authenticated by the signature, or just present.  Examples of attributes about the content would be the type of content, when the content was created, and who created the content.  Examples of attributes about the signature would be the algorithm and key used to create the signature, when the signature was created, and counter-signatures.</t>
      <t>When more than one signature is present, the successful validation of one signature associated with a given signer is usually treated as a successful signature by that signer.  However, there are some application environments where other rules are needed.  An application that employs a rule other than one valid signature for each signer must specify those rules.  Also, where simple matching of the signer identifier is not sufficient to determine whether the signatures were generated by the same signer, the application specification must describe how to determine which signatures were generated by the same signer.  Support of different communities of recipients is the primary reason that signers choose to include more than one signature.  For example, the COSE_Sign structure might include signatures generated with the RSA signature algorithm and with the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) signature algorithm.  This allows recipients to verify the signature associated with one algorithm or the other. (Source of text is <xref target="RFC5652" pageno="false" format="default"/>.) More detailed information on multiple signature evaluation can be found in <xref target="RFC5752" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>

      <t>In this section we describe the structure and methods to be used when doing an encryption in COSE.  In COSE, we use the same techniques and structures for encrypting both the plain text and the keys used to protect the text.  This is different from the approach used by both <xref target="RFC5652" pageno="false" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC7516" pageno="false" format="default"/> where different structures are used for the plain text and for the different key management techniques.</t>
      <t>One of the byproducts of using the same technique for encrypting and encoding both the content and the keys using the various key management techniques, is a requirement that all of the key management techniques use an Authenticated Encryption (AE) algorithm.  (For the purpose of this document we use a slightly loose definition of AE algorithms.) When encrypting the plain text, it is normal to use an Authenticated Encryption with Additional Data (AEAD) algorithm.  For key management, either AE or AEAD algorithms can be used.  See <xref target="AE-algo" pageno="false" format="default"/> for more details about the different types of algorithms.</t>

        <t>There are a number of different key management methods that can be used in the COSE encryption system.  In this section we will discuss each of the key management methods and what fields need to be specified to deal with each of them.</t>
        <t>The names of the key management methods used here are the same as are defined in <xref target="RFC7517" pageno="false" format="default"/>.  Other specifications use different terms for the key management methods or do not support some of the key management methods.</t>
        <t>At the moment we do not have any key management methods that allow for the use of protected headers.  This may be changed in the future if, for example, the AES-GCM Key wrap method defined in <xref target="RFC7518" pageno="false" format="default"/> were extended to allow for authenticated data.  In that event the use of the &#8216;protected&#8217; field, which is current forbidden below, would be permitted.</t>

          <t>In direct encryption mode, a shared secret between the sender and the recipient is used as the CEK.  When direct encryption mode is used, it MUST be the only mode used on the message.  It is a massive security leak to have both direct encryption and a different key management mode on the same message.</t>
          <t>For JOSE, direct encryption key management is the only key management method allowed for doing MAC-ed messages.  In COSE, all of the key management methods can be used for MAC-ed messages.</t>

          <t>In key wrapping mode, the CEK is randomly generated and that key is then encrypted by a shared secret between the sender and the recipient.  All of the currently defined key wrapping algorithms for JOSE (and thus for COSE) are AE algorithms.  Key wrapping mode is considered to be superior to direct encryption if the system has any capability for doing random key generation.  This is because the shared key is used to wrap random data rather than data  has some degree of organization and may in fact be repeating the same content.</t>

      <t>In this section we describe the structure and methods to be used when doing MAC authentication in COSE.  JOSE used a variant of the signature structure for doing MAC operations and it is restricted to using a single pre-shared secret to do the authentication.  This document allows for the use of all of the same methods of key management as are allowed for encryption.</t>
      <t>When using MAC operations, there are two modes in which it can be used.  The first is just a check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was computed.  Any of the key management methods can be used for this purpose.  The second mode is to both check that the content has not been changed since the MAC was computed, and to use key management to verify who sent it.  The key management modes that support this are ones that either use a pre-shared secret, or do static-static key agreement.  In both of these cases the entity MAC-ing the message can be validated by a key binding.  (The binding of identity assumes that there are only two parties involved and you did not send the message yourself.)</t>

      <t>For COSE we use the same set of fields that were defined in <xref target="RFC7517" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>

        <list style="symbols">
          <t>The restriction applies to the encoding the Sig_structure, the Enc_structure, and the MAC_structure.</t>
          <t>The rules for Canonical CBOR (Section 3.9 of RFC 7049) MUST be used in these locations.  The main rule that needs to be enforced is that all lengths in these structures MUST be encoded such that they are encoded using definite lengths and the minimum length encoding is used.</t>

      <t>While it is permitted to have key values other than those specified in this document in the outer maps (COSE_Sign, COSE_Signature, COSE_encrypt, COSE_recipient and COSE_mac), doing so is not encouraged.  Applications should make a determination if it will be permitted for that application.  In general, any needed new fields can be accomadated by the introduction of new header fields to be carried in the protected or unprotected fields.  Applications that need to have new fields in these maps should consider getting new message types assigned for these usages.  Without this change, old applications will not see and process the new fields.</t>

            <t>Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData includes the SignerInfo structure to convey per-signer information.  SignedData supports multiple signers and multiple signature algorithms per signer with multiple SignerInfo structures.  If a signer attaches more than one SignerInfo, there are concerns that an attacker could perform a downgrade attack by removing the SignerInfo(s) with the \'strong' algorithm(s).  This document defines the multiple-signatures attribute, its generation rules, and its processing rules to allow signers to convey multiple SignerInfo objects while protecting against downgrade attacks.  Additionally, this attribute may assist during periods of algorithm migration. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

      <t>The set of encryption algorithms that can be used with this specification is restricted to authenticated encryption (AE) and authenticated encryption with additional data (AEAD) algorithms.  This means that there is a strong check that the data decrypted by the recipient is the same as what was encrypted by the sender.  Encryption modes such as counter have no check on this at all.  The CBC encryption mode had a weak check that the data is correct, given a random key and random data, the CBC padding check will pass one out of 256 times.  There have been several times that a normal encryption mode has been combined with an integrity check to provide a content encryption mode that does provide the necessary authentication.  AES-GCM <xref target="AES-GCM" pageno="false" format="default"/>, AES-CCM <xref target="RFC3610" pageno="false" format="default"/>, AES-CBC-HMAC <xref target="I-D.mcgrew-aead-aes-cbc-hmac-sha2" pageno="false" format="default"/> are  examples of these composite modes.</t>
      <t>2PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport does not qualify as an AE algorithm.  There are only three bytes in the encoding that can be checked as having decrypted correctly, the rest of the content can only be probabilistically checked as having decrypted correctly.  For this reason, PKCS v1.5 RSA key transport MUST NOT be used with this specification.  RSA-OAEP was designed to have the necessary checks that that content correctly decrypted and does qualify as an AE algorithm.</t>
      <t>When dealing with authenticated encryption algorithms, there is always some type of value that needs to be checked to see if the authentication level has passed.  This authentication value may be:</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>A separately generated tag computed by both the encrypter and decrypter and then compared by the decryptor.  This tag value may be either placed at the end of the cipher text (the decision we made) or kept separately (the decision made by the JOSE working group).  This is the approach followed by AES-GCM <xref target="AES-GCM" pageno="false" format="default"/> and AES-CCM <xref target="RFC3610" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>A fixed value which is part of the encoded plain text.  This is the approach followed by the AES key wrap algorithm <xref target="RFC3394" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>
          <t>A computed value is included as part of the encoded plain text.  The computed value is then checked by the decryptor using the same computation path.  This is the approach followed by RSAES-OAEP <xref target="RFC3447" pageno="false" format="default"/>.</t>

Initial registration rules: Number may be a positive or a negative value.  Values in the range of -24 to 24 are Standards action required.  Values in the range of -256 to -25 and 25 to 255 are specification required with expert review.  Values from 256 to 512 are designated for private use.  All other values are reserved.</t>
